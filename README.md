Accessibility by bike is greatly impacted by the quality of bike-friendly infrastructure in an area. Typically, the area a person on a bike can reach within a certain distance is approximated by a circle. However, the actual area is reduced by the layout of the streets and a persons comfort at various Levels of Traffic Stress. In a recent video by @OhTheUrbanity, they accounted for the layout of the streets by reducing the radius of their accessibility circle. In my video, I calculate the actual area a person on a bike can access. I also compare the difference in area if a person is only comfortable with low-stress, LTS 1, infrastructure and if a person is comfortable on high-stress, LTS 4, infrastructure. While I use OpenStreetMap data and R to do my analysis, just like Oh The Urbanity! did, I restrict my analysis to just three origins in two cities. The additional time, data, and processing requirements to calculate the actual accessible area means that the vast majority of large accessibility studies use a circular area, like in the Oh The Urbanity! video.
